# mealchk-api

# Overview
mealchk-api is the API backend that is used by MealChk 2, a web app for detecting potential artificial or processed ingredients, and can be used to help aid following a paleo, whole30, or clean-eating lifestyle.

Please note that due to the way manufacturers label food, in some cases some ingredients may not always be detected.

This tool should not be used alone, but rather to supplement other checks.

# Technical documentation

mealchk-api is written in Python, and utilizes AWS AI/ML services for helping analyze provided data.
